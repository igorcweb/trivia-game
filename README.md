# Movies Trivia Quiz

### Description

The Movie Trivia Quiz Game consists of 10 questions with 4 multiple choice optioins. Every time the game is played, the correct answer is positioned at a different randomly selected place among the answer choices.

The game uses Giphy API. The diplayed gifs are based on the query taken from the correct answer. Because Giphy API is regularly updated, the diplayed gifs are not always going to be the same, but they will always be related to the correct answer.

The player has 30 seconds to answer each question. If the clock runs out, the game will automatically move on to the next question. After the quiz is finished, it will show the player the results and give the option to start over.

The game is hosted at https://igorcweb.github.io/trivia-game.
